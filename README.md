This project was conducted by our team to analyze CO2 levels in different rooms of the Akademiska Hus building. Together, we examined CO2 data for various classrooms and study rooms, identifying patterns and frequent breaches of the company's CO2 limit of 800ppm. Extreme values were recorded on several occasions, particularly on weekends. As a result of our analysis, we provided recommendations for improving ventilation and revising occupancy limits in these rooms
